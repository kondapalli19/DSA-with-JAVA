## Introduction

This repository is a resource for anyone looking to improve their understanding of data structures and algorithms using Java. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you can find valuable content, code samples, and explanations to help you with DSA.

## Data Structures

You'll find implementations of various data structures, including but not limited to:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Heaps
- Hash Tables
- Graphs
- and more!

Each data structure comes with code examples and explanations for better understanding.

## Algorithms

Explore a wide range of algorithm implementations in this repository. Some of the algorithms covered include:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., Binary Search)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- and more!

All code is provided with explanations and comments to facilitate learning and understanding.
